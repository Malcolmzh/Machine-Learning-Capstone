# Machine-Learning-Capstone
A final year project on utilising machine learning for heart disease and future detection.

## Data
The dataset was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset).

## Objective
This project was focused on tackling the following:
  * What are some early detectors of heart disease that can be detected?
  * How confident can we predict heart disease in a person who has not encountered any symptoms?
  * Does the age of the person play a role in the risk of the onset of heart disease?
  * Are we able to speed up the detection process using imaging technology?

## Analytical Tools
The following forms of analytical techniques were implemented:
  * Classification; Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, Confusion Matrix, Gradient Boosting Machine, Machine Vision.
  * Regression; Decision Tree, Regression Line, Mean Absolute Error/Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Squared Error, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine.
  * Unsupervised Learning; Random Forest, K-Means, Gradient Boosting Machine, Machine Vision.

## Conclusion
* Positive strong correlation between maximum heart rate and heart disease.
* Positive but very weak correlation between resting heart blood pressure and heart disease.
* Age is not a significant factor for a person developing heart related diseases.
